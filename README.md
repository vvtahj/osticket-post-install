# 🎛️ osTicket: Post-Installation Configuration

> After installing osTicket, I moved into the configuration phase — setting up departments, roles, agents, users, and SLAs to reflect a real-world IT helpdesk environment. I also tested the ticket submission and escalation process from multiple user perspectives (Admin, Agent, End User).
